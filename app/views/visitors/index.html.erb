<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Rushmore is a free, one-minute tool that estimates how the election
will affect a retirement account. And unlike your annoying neighbor,
Rushmore won’t tell you how to vote.</p>

<p>Rushmore uses forecasts from Moody’s (the independent organization that
  rates U.S. Treasury bonds) along with common benchmarks used by
  retirement planners, to estimate how the election will impact a theoretical
  retirement account, based on inputs you choose.</p>
